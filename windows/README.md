1] If you are using `ConfigureWindows.yml` to configure newly created windows system,
   Make sure that your host/group vars should be as follows :

~~~
ansible_user: Administrator
ansible_password: <password>
ansible_connection: winrm
ansible_winrm_transport: ntlm
ansible_port: 5985
ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation: ignore
~~~

2] Run the `ConfigureWindows.yml` and now your windows system is able to managed by control node.
