# This is very Basic playbook to configure windows host. It will connect windows host on port 5985
# with 'ntlm' winrm_transport. It will check for execution policy and will change it to Unrestricted.
# After that it will download the .ps1 file and will configure windows for ansible connection. Once 
# configuration is complete, it will set allowencrypted to true for basic authentication.
